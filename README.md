# A/B Test case study -- Data Analysis Nanodegree Program -- Udacity
---
## Overview:
The dataset I worked on during this project is comming from an e-commerce website, in which I tried to understand the relationship between the conversion rate and the landing page. The e-commerce company ran a test with two landing pages, an existing one and a new one on two different groups a control group and an experiment group, and I have to check if the new landing page have a conversion rate better than the existing one. During this analysis I tested multiple techniques starting with hypothesis test and ending with logistic regression. At the end I left my own interpretation on how I see the findings.
